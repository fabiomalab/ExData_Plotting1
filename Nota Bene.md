# Nota Bene

All pngs have been inserted in the figure folder.

The png corresponding to the plots have some automatic labeling that are in italian.
For this reason the weekdays are Gio, Ven and Sab instead of Thu, Fri and Sat
This is because my environmnent variables are set to suit my locality.
I decided not to touch the local environment variable to allow the users of these scripts to see the labels in their own language.

Cheers
